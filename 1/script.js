/* Construct a simulation of Math.random()
 * to verify how truly random it is
 */


//First, construct a for loop so we can run Math.random() x number of times


//within the for loop, run Math.random()


//If Math.random() is truly random, then its return value should be equally distributed between 0 and 1
//therefore, a value between 0 and 0.25 should occur 25% of the time, between 0.25 and 0.5, another 25%, and so on and so forth
//use if...else if...else to test that out


//Finally, print out the results in the following format
//"x number of simulations were run"
//"x% of results occurred between 0 and 0.25"
//"x% of results occurred between 0.25 and 0.5"
//...
